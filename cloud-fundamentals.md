# Cloud Fundamentals

## What is Cloud?


The cloud is a term referring to accessing computer, information technology (IT), and software applications through a network connection, often by accessing data centers using wide area networking (WAN) or Internet connectivity.


## What is difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS?

IAAS (Infrastructure As A Service) :

The base layer

Deals with Virtual Machines, Storage (Hard Disks), Servers, Network, Load Balancers etc

PAAS (Platform As A Service) :

A layer on top of IAAS

Runtimes (like java runtimes), Databases (like mySql, Oracle), Web Servers (tomcat etc)

SAAS (Software As A Service) :

A layer on top on PAAS

Applications like email (Gmail, Yahoo mail etc), Social Networking sites (Facebook etc)

To quickly relate consider the below Google's offerings:

##  What are Top benefits of cloud computing?


Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. What is it about cloud computing? Why is cloud computing so popular? Here are 6 common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:

### Cost
Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.


### Speed
Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.


### Global scale
The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when its needed and from the right geographic location.


### Productivity
On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware set up, software patching and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.


### Performance
The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.


##  Reliability
Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive, because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.


## Why are companies moving services to the cloud, and why would you want to consider moving your critical business applications from your data centers to the cloud? 

3 primary drivers of this shift:
- cost, 
- speedy introduction of new applications/services and 
- availability. 

The large cloud providers realize economies of scale in operating virtualized platforms that few enterprises can replicate.

##    Explain different models for deployment in cloud computing?

 
The different deployment models in cloud computing are

a)      Private Cloud

b)      Public Cloud

c)       Community Cloud

d)      Hybrid Cloud

##    What are the security aspects provided with cloud?

a)      Identity management: It authorizes the application services

b)      Access control: permission has to be provided to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment.

c)       Authentication and Authorization: Allows only the authorized and authenticated user only to access the data and applications
